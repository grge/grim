- BUG: Selecting siblings when on a source node does not work
- BUG: strange issue with sibling selectors ordered_candidates
    - on the initial A B C graph, moving to B, then repeatedly selecting the next
      sibling results in cycling between B and C, but the expected behaviour is to
      stay on C, since this is the right-most sibling. 
- BUG: A single self-connected node can't be selected
